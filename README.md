A tool based on persistent homology that enables you to connect disconnected branches.

A paper explaining the usage will appear here once it is made open.

This tool is based on the external structure in 
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.07436

and Stable Volume available in HomCloud https://homcloud.dev/index.en.html
